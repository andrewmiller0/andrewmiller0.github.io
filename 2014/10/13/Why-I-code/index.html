        <p>Coding has always been something that has appealed to me. I have always been interested in tech and computers, and as such, the programs that run on them interested me as well. In high school I took two coding classes that I enjoyed greatly. This led me to apply to colleges as a computer science major. I wound up putting my deposit down at Villanova and began my time there as a CS major.</p>
<h2 id="College_Years">College Years</h2>
<p>My first year at Villanova I enjoyed my coding classes. Obviously there were struggles and difficult projects, but overall I enjoyed CS. Being a very small department, CS majors of every level often got together for pizza parties, life discussions, and more. Since this was during the recession, jobs were scarce. All of the upper classmen, having difficulty finding internships and jobs, were enrolling in Villanova’s 5-year masters program so that they could become professors. I had no interest in teaching myself so I decided to switch majors, leaving CS behind.</p>
<h2 id="The_Realization">The Realization</h2>
<p>When I switched majors, Blackberries were still the coolest phones to have, a couple of your closest friends might have had facebook, and online banking was something only cutting edge banks offered. Being a dev was more of a niche job, and apps were still only an abbreviation for appetizers. By the time I graduated college, my  9 roommates and I all owned smartphones packed with app icons and web apps were rapidly replacing installed programs, and coding skill was rapidly becoming a standard job skill. I had jumped ship at the exact wrong moment.</p>
<h2 id="Redemption">Redemption</h2>
<p>I reached out to one of my sister’s friends who works as a consultant for numerous NYC-based start-ups. I was hoping that using my job experience(marketing and IT) I might be able to find a position. He made a couple of suggestions, but remarked that it would be so much easier if I could code. Almost as a joke, he suggested attending a coding bootcamp. Little did he know that I had long regretted my decision to switch majors and wished that I had coding. Starting in the summer, I began doing research into various bootcamps. I ultimately made the decision to enroll in the November session at Fullstack Academy. People don’t often get second chances, so I am ecstatic to have this opportunity. </p>
